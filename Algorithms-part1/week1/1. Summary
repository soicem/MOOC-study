1. "Why we study Algorithm and Data structures"

"I will, in fact, claim that the diffence between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his datastrucures more important.
Bad programmers worry about the code.  Good programmer worry about data structures and their relationships." - Linus Torvalds

2. Steps to developing a usable algorithm
-Model the problem
-Find an algorithm to solve it
-Fast enough? Fits in memory?
-If not, figure out why.
-Find a way to address the problem
-Iterate until satisfied
